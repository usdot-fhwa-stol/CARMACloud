# CARMA Cloud

## Documentation
CARMA Cloud provides some of the infrastructure components for CARMA. It enables users to define geofences, rules of practice, replay storms to test weather-related rules of practice, as well as monitor CARMA-enabled vehicles and the messages and controls exchanged with them.

## Deployment

CARMA Cloud can be deployed using docker-compose.  Ensure that you have a publicly-accessible Linux server with ports 80 and 443 inbound from the Internet permitted in the firewall rules, and with a DNS name pointed to the server's public IP address.

Clone this repository onto the Linux server using git. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and populate the environment variables as follows:


| Variable name        | Purpose                                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DNS_NAME             | This is the DNS name of the Linux server.                                            |
| CARMA_ADMIN_USER     | This will be the administrative username for the application.                        |
| CARMA_ADMIN_PASSWORD | This is the password for the administrative user.                                    |
| MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN  | This is the API token for Mapbox.                                                    |
| IMPLEMENTER_EMAIL    | This is your email address, used in the process of getting Letsencrypt certificates. |

Once the `.env` file is populated, run `sudo docker-compose up -d`. You can monitor your logs with `sudo docker-compose logs -f`

## Errors

The most likely error you'll encouter will occur when a new patch release for Tomcat happens. This may cause the build to fail. To quickly align to the correct version, adjust the `TOMCAT_VERSION` environment variable in the carma-cloud service dockerfile at `dockerfiles/carma-cloud.dockerfile`
